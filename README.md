### Build

To build you first need to install `go` tools. We recommend using go-1.8. You
can follow https://golang.org/doc/install#install 

You would also need `dep` and `goimports` installed and available in your PATH. 
You can follow the instructions on https://github.com/golang/dep and
https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports

Once you have the dependencies you can run this python script:
$ src/go/BUILD.py
